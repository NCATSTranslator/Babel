    Pulls gene information from Ensembl datasets, filters the datasets based on provided

    This function handles downloading and processing gene dataset information from Ensembl
    using the BioMart API. It allows filtering specific datasets and skips those marked to
    be excluded in configuration settings. Data is saved in a tab-separated value format for
    each dataset, and a log file is created indicating the number of processed datasets.

    :param ensembl_dir: The directory to download ENSEMBL files to.
    :param complete_file: A file that will be created to indicate that the pull is complete.
    :param only_download_datasets: A list of dataset IDs to download. If None, all
