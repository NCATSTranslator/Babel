# they are all imported from other sources.   Therefore, we will not generate labels or synonym files.  We
# do pull down data so that we can get the full list of ensembl identifiers though.

# In principle, we want to pull some file from somewhere, but ensembl, in all of its glory, lacks a list of
# genes that can be gathered without downloading hundreds of gigs of other stuff.  So, we'll use biomart to pull
# just what we need.
