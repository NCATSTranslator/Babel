    The subject and object can sometimes be a CUI and sometimes an AUI and you have to use
    CONSO to figure out how to go back and forth.
    Some of them are using SDUIs are you joking?

    Another issue: there are things like this:
    RXCUI:214199	has_active_ingredient	RXCUI:435
    RXCUI:214199	has_active_ingredient	RXCUI:7213
    In this case, what we have is a single drug that has two active ingredients.
    We don't want to glom in this case, because it unifies the two ingredients at the conflation level,
    which leads to everything is everything.
    So we're going to need to collect has_active_ingredients as we go and only export ones that are singular

    What's more, the same thing happens with has_precise_active_ingredient, and maybe has_ingredient.
    Also, the same subject and object will have the more general term as well.  so both a has_precise_active_ingredient
    and a has_ingredient will be between the same set of subject and object.  Also there's consists of, which will hav
    similar issues. So, we're going to do a lot of catching here

    has_tradename is even worse - it needs to be 1:1 to be useable

    Also, the same (cui) subject/object/predicate triple can be on multiple lines, obscured
    by the fact that auis and sduis are used in the file.  This happens when the effective triple comes from multiple
    sources. That's why the collections below need to be sets rather than lists
