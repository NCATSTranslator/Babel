    Generate the combined prefix report describing every CURIE and clique-leader prefix in the build.

    See thoughts at https://github.com/NCATSTranslator/Babel/issues/359

    This revives the output of the original ``generate_prefix_report`` (added in PR #363, later split
    into ``generate_curie_report``/``generate_clique_leaders_report``), but implemented with only
    *spillable* aggregates. The original OOM-killed the full graph because it used two non-spillable
    DuckDB operators -- ``COUNT(DISTINCT ...)`` (a full distinct hash set per group) and
    ``STRING_AGG(... '||' ...)`` (one giant delimited string per prefix). Neither can spill to disk,
    so no ``memory_limit`` setting saves them. Here every count comes from a plain ``GROUP BY <prefix>``
    (spillable) and every distinct/clique count from ``approx_count_distinct`` (a fixed-size HLL sketch,
    ~2% error). The exact occurrence counts (``COUNT``) stay exact; only distinct/clique counts are
    approximate.

    The output schema is the one used by the committed baselines in ``releases/prefix_reports/*.json``
    (and by babel-validation's PrefixComparator), so a freshly built report drops in beside them with
    no migration::

        {
            "name": <release name>,
            "count_curies": <int, exact>,
            "count_cliques": <int, approx>,

                "by_file": {"<filename>": {"<curie_prefix>": <int, exact>}},

                "distinct_clique_count": <int, approx>}},
