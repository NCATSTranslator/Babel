MR CONSO.RRF and MRSTY.RRF are files from UMLS 2019AB, generated by their weird java thing using umls.prop as the configuration

Where does hpo_errors come from and what does it mean?

First we pull MONDO and HP, we glom all the mondos and then we glom hp onto it.

Wthenever we find that we are merging two mondos, we write out a three column file:
1. HP term causing the merge
2. The term that is in common with that hp term and one of the mondos
3. The pre-formed clique of that mondo term

Then we go through by hand and for the most part we'll see something like
(HP term)   {snomed:}   {MONDO with same name as HP, snomed, others}
(HP term)   {umls:}   {MONDO with different name as HP, umls, others}
 
And we decide which of these is the best match to the HP term.  When it s a good match, i.e. we'd like to join that
HP term with the MONDO, then we delete that row.  We're leaving the rows that are bad.  Then we can use this file to 
go back and filter our HP terms, removing anything from column 2.

In some cases, we leave all of the rows - these are what we think are bad matches, and the HP shouldn't join with any of the
mondoes.

In one case, it looks like the two mondo terms SHOULD be merged.  In that case, we delete both rows.

The disease_phenotype script will now pull this file in and use it to clean things up.
