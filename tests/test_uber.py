# These tests require a live connection to ubergraph.apps.renci.org.
# They are only run when pytest is invoked with --network or --all
# (see tests/conftest.py for CLI options).
#
# The shared `ubergraph` fixture (tests/conftest.py) handles three cases:
#   - Network unreachable → all tests SKIP with the connection error
#   - Server reachable but returns HTTP error on probe → all tests XFAIL
# Within each test, _server_errors_are_xfail() catches SPARQL exceptions and
# marks that test XFAIL, while assertion failures on valid-but-wrong data are
# normal failures.
