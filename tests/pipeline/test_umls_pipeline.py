"""UMLS-specific pipeline tests (issue #675 extension).

The generic non-empty and mutual-exclusivity tests for all seven UMLS compendia
(chemicals, protein, anatomy, disease/phenotype, process/activity, taxon, gene)
are in test_vocabulary_partitioning.py.  This file contains only the
UMLS-specific targeted test that has no generic equivalent.

All tests require UMLS_API_KEY to be set for the initial download (or the
files to already be cached in babel_downloads/UMLS/).  They are skipped by
default.  Run with:
    PYTHONPATH=. uv run pytest tests/pipeline/test_umls_pipeline.py --pipeline --no-cov -v
