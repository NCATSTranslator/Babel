"""Unit tests for pull_via_wget()'s recursive, timestamping download.

This is the mechanism that makes preloading PubMed downloads from a previous run work (see
docs/RunningBabel.md, "Preloading PubMed downloads"): a recursive `wget --timestamping` fetch
must leave already-present files alone and download only the ones we don't have yet.

The tests run against a throwaway HTTP server on localhost, so they need no external network —
but they do need the `wget` binary, and are skipped if it isn't installed.
