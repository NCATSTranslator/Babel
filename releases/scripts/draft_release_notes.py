"""Draft a combined Babel/NodeNorm/NameRes release note.

Babel ships to Translator as a build plus the NodeNorm and NameRes versions deployed against it, so
a release note has to cover all three repositories. This assembles the mechanical parts of that note
-- the pull request list, the version bumps, the per-compendium count table -- and leaves the
judgement to a human: every PR comes out as an unchecked checklist item to triage, keep or delete.

Everything except the build directory comes from ``releases/releases.yaml``. The entry below the one
being drafted supplies the baselines, so the three PR ranges are derived rather than remembered::

    uv run python releases/scripts/draft_release_notes.py 2026jul22 \\
        --build-dir /path/to/2026jul22 > releases/2026jul22.md

PRs are collected with ``gh api .../compare/BASE...HEAD``, which asks GitHub for the commits reachable
from HEAD but not from BASE. That is the only correct way to do this: NameRes v1.5.2 was cut *after*
v1.6.2 as a maintenance release on the v1.5 line, so neither a version sort nor a date sort produces
the right set. The compare endpoint follows the actual history.
