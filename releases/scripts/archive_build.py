"""Archive a build's summary reports into ``releases/<build>/``.

A finished build directory is hundreds of gigabytes and lives on a cluster that will eventually be
cleaned. A small part of it -- the summary tables, the per-compendium content reports, and the
provenance metadata -- is what people actually read afterwards, and what the next release is
compared against. This copies that subset (~420 KB) into the repository.

**The archive mirrors the build directory's own layout**, so every relative path is the same on both
sides and ``releases/2026jul22`` is itself a usable ``--build-dir``::

    uv run python releases/scripts/draft_release_notes.py 2026jul22 --build-dir releases/2026jul22

which is what keeps a note re-draftable years after the build directory is gone. Adding a
translation layer between "path in a build" and "path in the archive" would buy nothing and cost
that property, so don't.

What is deliberately *not* archived: ``benchmarks/`` and ``reports/slurm/`` (operational, only
useful while sizing that run), ``logs/``, ``reports/umls/`` and the loose ``reports/<Type>.txt``
(diagnostics rather than summaries), and ``reports/duckdb/*.tsv{,.gz}`` -- one of which is 200 MB,
which is why :data:`MAX_FILE_MB` exists. See ``releases/ARTIFACTS.md``.

Deliberately imports nothing from ``src/``: this is release engineering, not pipeline code (the same
reasoning as ``draft_release_notes.py``).
