# Data formats

There are three custom formats used within Babel outputs.

## Compendia files

Compendia files are JSON Lines (JSONL) files in the `compendia/` directory. Each line consists of a
single "clique" -- a set of identifiers that Babel believes represents the same concept. Here is an
example from `compendia/Gene.txt` for the
[glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit 1 (G6PC1)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2538) gene.

```json
{
  "ic": "100",
  "identifiers": [
    {

      "l": "G6PC1",
      "d": [],
      "t": [
        "NCBITaxon:9606"
      ]
    },
    {
      "i": "ENSEMBL:ENSG00000131482",
      "l": "G6PC1 (Hsap)",
      "d": [],
      "t": []
    },
    {
      "i": "HGNC:4056",
      "l": "G6PC1",

    },
    {

      "d": [],
      "t": []
    },
    {
      "i": "UMLS:C1414892",
      "l": "G6PC1 gene",
      "d": [],
      "t": []
    }
  ],
  "preferred_name": "G6PC1",
  "taxa": [
    "NCBITaxon:9606"
  ],
  "type": "biolink:Gene"
}
```

This entry consists of the following fields:

| Field            | Value                                                       | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ic               | 100                                                         | Information content value (see [Understanding.md](./Understanding.md#what-are-information-content-values)). They are decimal values that range from 0.0 (high-level broad term with many subclasses) to 100.0 (very specific term with no subclasses).                 |
| identifiers      | _See below_                                                 | A list of identifiers for this clique. This is arranged in the same order as the valid ID prefixes for this type in the Biolink Model, e.g. [starting with NCBIGene and ENSEMBL for `biolink:Gene`](https://biolink.github.io/biolink-model/Gene/#valid-id-prefixes). |
| identifiers[0].i | NCBIGene:2538                                               | A CURIE representing this identifier. You can use the [Biolink Model prefixmap](https://github.com/biolink/biolink-model/tree/master/project/prefixmap) to expand this into a full concept IRI.                                                                       |
| identifiers[0].l | G6PC1                                                       | A label for this identifier. This will almost always be from the source of the CURIE (in this case, the label is from the NCBI Gene database).                                                                                                                        |
| identifiers[0].d | (blank in this example, but usually 1-3 sentences)          | A description of this identifier or concept from this source.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| identifiers[0].t | ["NCBITaxon:9606"]                                          | A list of taxa that this concept is found in as NCBITaxon CURIEs. NCBITaxon:9606 refers to the species _Homo sapiens_.                                                                                                                                                |
| preferred_name   | G6PC1                                                       | The preferred name for this clique. This is not currently used by NodeNorm, but will be in the future.                                                                                                                                                                |
| taxa             | ["NCBITaxon:9606"]                                          | A list of taxa that this concept is found in as NCBITaxon CURIEs. This is combined from all the individual taxa from each identifier.                                                                                                                                 |
| type             | biolink:Gene                                                | The Biolink type of this concept. Must be a class from the [Biolink model](https://biolink.github.io/biolink-model/) with a `biolink:` prefix.                                                                                                                        |

The first identifier in the `identifiers` list is considered the "clique leader" or "preferred ID"
for the clique. When normalizing an identifier, that identifier is used to represent the entire
clique. The preferred name is not necessarily the label for the clique leader -- another name may be
chosen to clarify the meaning of the clique or to provide a better label for displaying in the
Translator UI.

## Synonym files

Synonym files are JSONL files, where each entry is a JSON document describing a concept and all its
synonyms.

This entry consists of the following fields:

| Field                   | Value                              | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Note that the equivalent identifiers are not included.                                                                                                                                                            |
| curie_suffix            | 2538                               | If the CURIE suffix is completely numerical, it will be stored in this field as a number. This is used to sort search results, with lower CURIE suffixes appearing first.                                                                   |

| shortest_name_length    | 4                                  | The length of the shortest synonym in the `names` list, in order to sort results for the shortest name.                                                                                                                                     |

| types                   | ["Gene", "GeneOrGeneProduct", ...] | A list of Biolink types (without the `biolink:` prefix) for this concept. This is arranged in the same order provided by the Biolink Model Toolkit, starting with the narrowest concept, expanding to the broadest, followed by mixins.     |

Note that the synonym files are generated with DrugChemical conflation turned on, but GeneProtein
conflation turned off.

## Conflation files

There are only two conflation files: `GeneProtein.txt` and `DrugChemical.txt`, corresponding to the
two currently supported conflation methods. Both files have the same format: a JSONL file where each
entry is a list of clique leaders (i.e. the first identifier for a clique in the
[Compendia files](#compendia-files)) that should be combined under that conflation. For example, the
following entry indicates that if either `NCBIGene:2538` or `UniProtKB:P35575` is queried with
GeneProtein conflation turned on, then a combined clique of both identifiers should be returned.

```json
["NCBIGene:2538", "UniProtKB:P35575"]
```

Here is the response when normalizing `UniProtKB:P35575` from NodeNorm when both GeneProtein
conflation and individual types are turned on:

```json
{
  "UniProtKB:P35575": {
    "id": {
      "identifier": "NCBIGene:2538",
      "label": "G6PC1"
    },
    "equivalent_identifiers": [
      {
        "identifier": "NCBIGene:2538",
        "label": "G6PC1",

      },
      {

        "type": "biolink:Gene"
      },
      {
        "identifier": "OMIM:613742",
        "type": "biolink:Gene"
      },
      {
        "identifier": "UMLS:C1414892",
        "label": "G6PC1 gene",
        "type": "biolink:Gene"
      },
      {
        "identifier": "UniProtKB:P35575",
        "label": "G6PC1_HUMAN Glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit 1 (sprot)",
        "type": "biolink:Protein"
      },
      {

        "label": "glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit 1 (human)",
        "type": "biolink:Protein"
      },
      {
        "identifier": "UMLS:C4549614",
        "label": "G6PC1 protein, human",
        "type": "biolink:Protein"
      }
    ],
    "type": [
      "biolink:Gene",
      "biolink:GeneOrGeneProduct",
      "biolink:GenomicEntity",
      "biolink:ChemicalEntityOrGeneOrGeneProduct",
      "biolink:PhysicalEssence",
      "biolink:OntologyClass",
      "biolink:BiologicalEntity",
      "biolink:ThingWithTaxon",
      "biolink:NamedThing",

      "biolink:MacromolecularMachineMixin",
      "biolink:Protein",

      "biolink:Polypeptide",
      "biolink:ChemicalEntityOrProteinOrPolypeptide"
    ],
    "information_content": 88.2
  }
}
```

Note that this includes both biolink:Gene identifiers (such as
[HGNC:4056](https://alliancegenome.org/gene/HGNC:4056)) and biolink:Protein identifiers (such as
[UniProtKB:P35575](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P35575)).

## DuckDB and Parquet exports

The `babel_outputs/duckdb/` directory contains the same information as the JSONL files above,
reformatted for analytical queries. The intended use case is index-wide queries that would be
impractical against the raw JSONL — for example, finding synonyms shared across multiple cliques,
computing synonym-length distributions, or checking prefix coverage across semantic types. There
are no fixed downstream consumers yet; the schema is evolving.

The export is produced by `src/snakefiles/duckdb.snakefile` via
`src/exporters/duckdb_exporters.py`. Each semantic type gets a subdirectory under
`babel_outputs/duckdb/parquet/filename={Type}/` containing one or more Parquet files. A
transient DuckDB database (`.duckdb`) is written alongside each set of Parquet files during
export and can be used directly for interactive querying, but the Parquet files are the
durable output.

### Compendium tables (`filename={Type}/Node.parquet`, `Clique.parquet`, `Edge.parquet`)

These three tables are derived from the compendia JSONL for each semantic type.

`Node.parquet` — one row per identifier across all cliques:

| Column       | Type            | Meaning                                          |
|--------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| curie        | STRING          | The identifier CURIE, e.g. `NCBIGene:2538`       |
| curie_prefix | STRING          | The prefix portion of the CURIE, e.g. `NCBIGene` |
| label        | STRING          | The label for this identifier, if any            |
| label_lc     | STRING          | Lower-cased label (for case-insensitive search)  |
| description  | STRING[]        | Description text(s) for this identifier          |
| taxa         | STRING[]        | Taxa CURIEs associated with this identifier      |

`Clique.parquet` — one row per clique:

| Column                   | Type   | Meaning                                                   |
|--------------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| clique_leader            | STRING | CURIE of the preferred identifier for the clique          |
| preferred_name           | STRING | Preferred display name for the clique                     |
| clique_identifier_count  | INT    | Number of identifiers in the clique                       |
| biolink_type             | STRING | Biolink type, e.g. `biolink:Gene`                         |
| information_content      | FLOAT  | Information content value (0–100)                         |

`Edge.parquet` — one row per (clique, identifier) pair; the primary way to look up which
clique contains a given CURIE:

| Column               | Type   | Meaning                                              |
|----------------------|--------|------------------------------------------------------|
| clique_leader        | STRING | CURIE of the clique's preferred identifier           |
| curie                | STRING | An identifier that belongs to this clique            |
| conflation           | STRING | Conflation type if applicable, otherwise `'None'`    |
| clique_leader_prefix | STRING | Prefix of the clique leader CURIE                    |
| curie_prefix         | STRING | Prefix of the member CURIE                           |

### Synonym table (`filename={Type}/Synonyms.parquet`)

Derived from the synonym JSONL files. One row per (clique, synonym) pair — i.e., the `names`
array from the synonym file is unnested so each individual synonym gets its own row. This makes
synonym-frequency queries straightforward at the cost of a large row count for types with many
synonyms per concept (notably `Protein` and `GeneProteinConflated`, which have hundreds of
UniProt synonyms per entry).

| clique_leader    | STRING | CURIE of the clique's preferred identifier         |
| preferred_name   | STRING | Preferred display name for the clique              |
| preferred_name_lc| STRING | Lower-cased preferred name                         |
| biolink_type     | STRING | Biolink type, e.g. `biolink:Gene`                  |
| label            | STRING | One synonym from the `names` list                  |
| label_lc         | STRING | Lower-cased synonym                                |

### Conflation table (`filename={ConflationName}/Conflation.parquet`)

Derived from the conflation JSONL files (`GeneProtein.txt`, `DrugChemical.txt`). One row per
(conflation group, member CURIE):
