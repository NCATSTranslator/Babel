# MeSH ingestion and tree partitioning

This document describes how Babel ingests Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) data: how MeSH's
hierarchy is split across Babel's compendia, how Supplementary Concept Records are typed, and
which parts of MeSH we deliberately do not incorporate.

The MeSH data handler is `src/datahandlers/mesh.py`; the per-compendium routing lives in each
compendium's `write_mesh_ids()` function (in `src/createcompendia/`).

## Source data

MeSH is downloaded as an RDF N-Triples dump to `babel_downloads/MESH/mesh.nt` (a few GB). It
uses the MeSH RDF vocabulary (`meshv:`, `<http://id.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/vocab#>`) and these
predicates matter most for ingestion:

- `meshv:treeNumber` — a descriptor's position(s) in the MeSH tree (e.g. `D02.455...`). A
  descriptor can sit in multiple trees.
- `meshv:mappedTo` / `meshv:preferredMappedTo` — link a Supplementary Concept Record (SCR) to the
  main-heading descriptor(s) it is filed under. SCRs do **not** have tree numbers of their own.
- `rdf:type` — for SCRs, this is the SCR class (see below).
- `rdfs:label` — the human-readable name.

If `babel_downloads/MESH/mesh.nt` is present locally, it is directly greppable for ad hoc lookups
(a CURIE's `rdf:type`, `treeNumber`, `mappedTo`, `#label`) without running the pipeline — much
faster than re-deriving from the handler for one-off questions. For example, to inspect a single
record:

```bash
grep -E "mesh/C038967>" babel_downloads/MESH/mesh.nt \
  | grep -E "#type|mappedTo|#label|treeNumber"
```

## How MeSH is split across compendia

MeSH is partitioned by its top-level tree letter. Each consuming compendium declares its own
`meshmap` (tree-prefix → Biolink type) and calls `mesh.write_ids()`, which expands each tree
prefix to all descriptors under it. The current routing:

- **A01–A20 Anatomy** → anatomy (`ANATOMICAL_ENTITY`; `A11` Cells → `CELL`,
  `A11.284` → `CELLULAR_COMPONENT`). See `anatomy.write_mesh_ids()`.
- **B01–B05 Organisms** → taxon (`ORGANISM_TAXON`). See `taxon.write_mesh_ids()`.
- **C Diseases** (C01, C04–C22, C24–C26) → disease (`DISEASE`); **C23** → `PHENOTYPIC_FEATURE`.
  See `diseasephenotype.write_mesh_ids()`. Note C02 (Virus Diseases) and C03 (Parasitic Diseases)
  are intentionally absent pending verification of MONDO/HPO cross-references.
- **D01–D26 Chemicals & Drugs** → chemical (`CHEMICAL_ENTITY`, with mixture and polypeptide
  overrides); protein subtrees (`D05.500`, `D05.875`, `D08.244`, `D08.622`, `D08.811`, `D12.776`)
  are split off to protein (`PROTEIN`). See `chemicals.write_mesh_ids()` and
  `protein.write_mesh_ids()`.

When the same descriptor appears in multiple trees with conflicting types, `mesh.write_ids()`
resolves the conflict using the `order` argument (an explicit type priority list) and an
`EXCLUDE` sentinel.

### Chemical and protein partition the same D-trees independently

`chemicals.write_mesh_ids()` and `protein.write_mesh_ids()` each declare their own view of the D
subtrees (chemicals marks the protein subtrees `EXCLUDE`; protein claims them as `PROTEIN`). These
two lists are maintained separately (there is a `TODO` in `chemicals.write_mesh_ids()` about
unifying them). When changing a D-tree assignment in one, check the other so an identifier does
not end up in both compendia or in neither.

## Supplementary Concept Records (SCRs)

SCRs are the `MESH:C…` records (as opposed to `MESH:D…` main-heading descriptors). They have **no
tree numbers of their own**. Instead they are:

1. Typed by their RDF class — one of `meshv:SCR_Chemical`, `meshv:SCR_Organism`,
   `meshv:SCR_Disease`, `meshv:SCR_Protocol`, `meshv:SCR_Population`, `meshv:SCR_Anatomy`.
2. Filed under one or more main-heading descriptors via `meshv:mappedTo` /
   `meshv:preferredMappedTo`.

`mesh.write_ids()` ingests SCRs through its `extra_vocab` argument (`{SCR_class: biolink_type}`)
and routes them by gating their mapped descriptors against a tree list:

- `scr_include_trees` — keep only SCRs whose mapped descriptors fall under these trees.
- `scr_exclude_trees` — drop SCRs whose mapped descriptors fall under these trees.

The two options are mutually exclusive. `get_scr_terms_mapped_to_trees()` does the
descriptor → tree lookup.

Because SCRs are typed by class and not by tree, **a "MeSH X is missing" bug is frequently an
unconsumed SCR class rather than a typing error** — the record is dropped before any type is
assigned.

### SCR class coverage (as of 2026 dump)

The approximate record counts and current handling:

- **`SCR_Chemical`** (~250,000) — consumed by chemical and protein (split via
  `scr_include_trees` / `scr_exclude_trees` on the protein D subtrees).
- **`SCR_Organism`** (~66,000) — consumed by taxon.
- **`SCR_Disease`** (~6,800) — **not consumed.** Specific/rare diseases (OMIM-style), preferred-
  mapped to C-tree descriptors. High-value gap for the disease compendium.
- **`SCR_Population`** (~1,800) — **not consumed.** Ethnic/national/tribal groups; tied to the
  Population and Community Ontology (PCO) work, not chemicals/diseases.
- **`SCR_Protocol`** (~1,200) — **not consumed.** ~98% chemotherapy drug-combination regimens
  (preferred-mapped to `D000971` Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols); the rest are
  questionnaires/diagnostic/vaccination protocols.
- **`SCR_Anatomy`** (~24) — **not consumed.** Tiny anatomy tail.

## Coverage audit

Babel does not ingest every MeSH branch. Whole top-level categories (E procedures/equipment, F
psychiatry/psychology except disease-like F03, G phenomena/processes, H–N, V, Z) and the D27
Chemical Actions and Uses tree are currently out of scope, along with the four unconsumed SCR
classes above. The standing audit of what we do and don't incorporate — with a per-branch
keep/skip recommendation — is tracked in
[issue #807](https://github.com/NCATSTranslator/Babel/issues/807). Consult it before adding or
removing a MeSH branch.
