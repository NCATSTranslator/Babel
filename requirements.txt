# We used to install apybiomart (https://github.com/robertopreste/apybiomart/tree/master) from
# https://pypi.org/project/apybiomart/, but this hasn't been modified in five years and it depends
# on checking if it's online via http://httpstat.us/200, which is often offline. My branch of this
# https://github.com/gaurav/apybiomart/tree/change-check-url and changes that to https://example.org.
